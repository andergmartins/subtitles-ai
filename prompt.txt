Format Portuguese subtitles for accessibility, breaking text into two-line subtitles:
- First line max 32 characters
- Second line at least half the first line's length
- Prioritize breaking at verbs, conjunctions, prepositions
- Maintain original text's meaning and words

Key Guidelines:
- Avoid orphan single words on second line
- Keep natural text flow
- Preserve original Portuguese text exactly

Objectives:
1. Semantic line breaks
2. Compact subtitle formatting
3. Readability preservation
4. Consistent two-line structure

Processing Rules:
- If second line has only one word, merge with first line
- Ensure smooth, natural text segmentation
- Respect character count limits strictly

Example Input: "Ao vê-la, o Senhor Se compadeceu dela e disse: "Não chore." Lucas 7:13"
Expected Output:
Ao vê-la, o Senhor
Se compadeceu dela

e disse: "Não chore."
Lucas 7:13
